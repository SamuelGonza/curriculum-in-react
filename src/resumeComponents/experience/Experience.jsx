            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p className="pNormal centrado">
                I am primarily a web developer in which I focus on reviewing the needs of my clients for developer needs of any conceivable kind. You can view open-source projects and contributions on my <a href="http://github.com/SamuelVasquezGonzalez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="@SamuelVasquezGonzalez on Github">GitHub</a>.

                My story begins when I was 9 years old, I became interested in the world of development when I asked myself "How do I make games?", I searched a bit and found a video of Mark Zuckerberg who talked about whether everyone could program what, to be honest. , I did not understand very well when I was that age, later I found a Spanish channel called Nodician, which was dedicated to making game tutorials in Unity with C#, I made my first games watching these tutorials and from there I knew that I liked this.

            <p className="pNormal centrado">
                But it really all started in high school, after losing 2 years, I knew that I had to change something in myself and I needed to start having discipline if I really wanted everything to improve in my personal life. The pandemic began and that's where this story began. I learned all the knowledge from different courses that I took on YouTube that <a href="/resume#inspirations">I will quote later</a>, so I do not have any certification that I am studying something. I started to see what <b>HTML</b> I quickly understood, as well as <b>CSS</b>.
            </p>
            <p className="pNormal centrado">
                After carrying out simple projects in HTML and CSS, I began to see <b>Javascript</b>. It cost me a lot at first but I got more practice over time. It was a 30-hour course in which I learned a lot. I was so eager to learn that I could perfectly spend a full day practicing, it was a year and a half of doing projects and practicing, I clarify that I never learned "programming logic" so I just had to learn the language.
            </p>
            <p className="pNormal centrado">
                Then, I knew that I had to scale up from there because I wanted to do bigger projects and jobs. I tried to learn python to make the backend of my applications but I did not adapt and since I had already heard about <b>Node</b>, I began to study it, it cost me much more because I had to learn many new models, templates, ports, asynchrony, module requirements, etc. but thanks to the effort I put in, I can work it without problems.
            </p>
            <p className="pNormal centrado">
                Then I learned basic <b>MySql</b> that I need to use in a few projects. I focused on learning technologies that are in demand so I decided it was time to learn <b>React</b>. My main language is Javascript and I've been using it with React ever since I learned it. I use <b>Git</b> to keep track of my apps when they start scaling and <b>GitHub</b> to store all my repos
